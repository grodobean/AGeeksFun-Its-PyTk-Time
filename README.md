# A Geek's Fun
A Python TKinter File.
The point of this project is to add all the things we can to a python file as long as it is legal and is developed with for GUI, that means no print() guys
Have fun and add more modules and create your own functions.
Make a module, maybe even a simple snake game, but remember GUI, no CLI. Turtle Graphics are allowed.
